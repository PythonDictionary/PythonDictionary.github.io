  <p><strong>Samo Tomášik</strong> (1813–1887) was a Slovak romantic poet, writer, and national revivalist, best known for his contributions to Slovak literature and patriotic thought. Deeply influenced by the cultural movement led by Ľudovít Štúr, Tomášik played a significant role in promoting the Slovak language and identity during a period of growing national consciousness.</p>

  <p>Born in the village of Jelšava, Tomášik studied in Rožňava, Levoča, and later in Germany. He worked as a Lutheran pastor and teacher, using his platform to inspire and educate the Slovak people. His literary work spanned poetry, prose, and historical writing, often highlighting themes of national pride, moral integrity, and resistance against oppression.</p>

  <p>Among his most famous works is the patriotic song <em>Hej, Slováci</em>, which later became a symbol of Slavic unity and the national anthem of former Yugoslavia. His poetry reflects both romantic sentiment and a strong call for national awakening, often drawing from folklore and the Slovak rural landscape.</p>

  <p>Samo Tomášik remains a respected figure in Slovak culture, celebrated for his literary achievements and his dedication to the Slovak national cause during a pivotal time in the country's history.</p>
