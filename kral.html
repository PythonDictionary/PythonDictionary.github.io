  <div class="bio">
    <p><strong>Janko Kráľ</strong> (1822–1876) was one of the most prominent Slovak poets of the Romantic era and an important figure in the Slovak national revival. A fervent supporter of Ľudovít Štúr, Kráľ participated in the revolutionary movements of 1848 and was known for his defiant and radical views.</p>

    <p>He was born in Liptovský Mikuláš and studied in Bratislava, where he became actively involved with the Štúr group. His poetry is marked by vivid imagery, revolutionary spirit, and deep patriotism. Král drew inspiration from folk tales, legends, and nature, often portraying himself as a rebellious hero.</p>

    <p>Among his most notable poems are <em>Duma bratislavská</em>, <em>Zakliata panna vo váhu a divný Janko</em>, and <em>Dráma sveta</em>. These works combine romantic idealism with political urgency, encouraging Slovaks to rise up and assert their national identity. Unfortunately, much of his literary work was lost, but his legacy remains influential in Slovak literature and national consciousness.</p>

    <p>Janko Kráľ is remembered as a symbol of youthful rebellion, poetic fervor, and unwavering commitment to Slovak cultural and political emancipation.</p>
